We provide the source code for the symbolic execution engine. It is recommended to build the engine using Docker for easier setup and environment management. Please note that the Docker container will consume approximately 30GB of memory to store the experiment results.

```
docker build -t klee/klee .
```

This will build a docker image `"klee"` which contains all the necessary materials to reproduce our experiments.

To launch the container:

```
./run_docker.sh
```

In case you cannot build a image, we provide a [pre-built docker image on Docker Hub](TODO) Execute the following command to use it:

```
docker rmi perry:latest
docker pull ray999/perry
docker tag ray999/perry perry:latest
cd perry
./run_docker.sh
```

To build KLEE, run the following commands:

```
cd /home/klee/klee_src
mkdir build
cmake \
  -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_DEBUG="-g" \
  -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS_DEBUG="-g" \
  -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELEASE="-O3 -DNDEBUG" \
  -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS_RELEASE="-O3 -DNDEBUG" \
  -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELWITHDEBINFO="-O2 -g -DNDEBUG" \
  -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS_RELWITHDEBINFO="-O2 -g -DNDEBUG" \
  -DENABLE_SOLVER_STP=ON \
  -DENABLE_POSIX_RUNTIME=ON \
  -DSTP_DIR=/tmp/stp-2.3.3-install/lib/cmake/STP/ \
  ..
make -j
```

To run symbolic execution for ThreadX system calls, navigate to the **KOM-experiment** folder and execute the Python script. Most system calls will complete normally within 5 minutes, except for mutex_delete and mutex_put. These two system calls may take up to 9 hours to finish, depending on the host machineâ€™s performance.

```
cd KOM-experiment/scripts
python3 run_test_system_calls.py
```

The symbolic execution results will be stored in the *results/output* and *results/test-info-output* folders. To further evaluate the runtime overhead and analyze the modifiable fields, run the following:

```
python3 run_analysis.py
```

This command will generate four Excel files in the results folder, containing runtime evaluation data and information on the modifiable fields (M1, M2, and M3), as shown in Tables 2 and 3 in our paper.
